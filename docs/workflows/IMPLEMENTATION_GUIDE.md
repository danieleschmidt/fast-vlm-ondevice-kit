# GitHub Actions Implementation Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

This repository is ready for GitHub Actions workflows but requires manual implementation of the YAML files in `.github/workflows/`.

## Required Workflows

Based on the repository's ADVANCED maturity level and multi-platform architecture, the following workflows should be implemented:

### 1. Core CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
- Python testing (pytest with coverage)
- Swift testing (XCTest)
- Code quality checks (black, isort, mypy, flake8, ruff)
- Security scanning (bandit, safety)
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### 2. Release Automation (`release.yml`)
- Automated versioning
- PyPI package publishing
- Swift Package Manager release
- GitHub release creation
- Changelog generation

### 3. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SAST with CodeQL
- Container security scanning
- Secrets detection

### 4. Performance Monitoring (`performance.yml`)
- Benchmark automation
- Performance regression detection
- Mobile performance profiling

## Implementation References

Detailed workflow templates are available in:
- `docs/workflows/GITHUB_ACTIONS_TEMPLATES.md`
- `docs/workflows/ci-cd-implementation.md`
- `docs/workflows/release-management.md`

## Manual Setup Required

Since this repository manages critical ML models and mobile deployment, workflow implementation requires careful review and manual setup by repository maintainers.

Please refer to the comprehensive documentation in the `docs/workflows/` directory for complete implementation guidance.

## Alternative Task Automation

While GitHub Actions workflows require manual setup, this repository now includes modern task automation through:
- **Justfile**: Run `just` to see available commands
- **Taskfile**: Run `task` to see available commands
- **DevContainer**: Automated development environment setup
